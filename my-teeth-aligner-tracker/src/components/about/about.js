            <h3>A Solution Born from Necessity</h3>
            <p>
              When SmileDirectClub shut down, leaving many without a way to
              track their aligner progress, the idea for SmileMinder was
              sparked. It's not just a tool for me, but for everyone facing this
              challenge.
            </p>
            <br></br>

            <h3>The Core of SmileMinder</h3>
            <p>
              SmileMinder is a labor of love and a testament to
              self-empowerment. As a solo developer, I've crafted this platform
              to be intuitive, user-friendly, and reliable, reflecting years of
              insights and experiences.
            </p>
            <br></br>

            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>
              SmileMinder aims to empower users to track their aligner treatment
              effortlessly. It's designed to support you, whether you're
              starting out or well into your journey.
            </p>
            <br></br>

            <h3>Your Journey, Our Shared Path</h3>
